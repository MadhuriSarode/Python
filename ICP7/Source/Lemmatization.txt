Larry

began
in
January
1996
a
a
research
project
by
Larry

and
Sergey

when
they
were
both
PhD
student
at
Stanford
University
in
Stanford
,
California
.
[

The
project
initially
involved
an
unofficial
``
third
founder
''
,
Scott
Hassan
,
the
original
lead
programmer
who
wrote
much
of
the
code
for
the
original
Google
Search
engine
,
but
he
left
before
Google
wa
officially
founded
a
a
company
;
[

[
20

Hassan
went
on
to
pursue
a
career
in
robotics
and
founded
the
company
Willow
Garage
in
2006
.
[

[

While
conventional
search
engine
ranked
result
by
counting
how
many
time
the
search
term
appeared
on
the
page
,
they
theorized
about
a
better
system
that
analyzed
the
relationship
among
website
.
[
23
]
They
called
this
algorithm
PageRank
;
it
determined
a
website
's
relevance
by
the
number
of
page
,
and
the
importance
of
those
page
that
linked
back
to
the
original
site
.
[

[
25
]
Page
told
his
idea
to
Hassan
,
who
began
writing
the
code
to
implement
Page
's
idea
.
[
19
]
Page
and
Brin
originally
nicknamed
the
new
search
engine
``
BackRub
''
,
because
the
system
checked
backlinks
to
estimate
the
importance
of
a
site
.
[

Hassan

well
a
Alan

cited
by
Page

a
being
critical
to
the
development
of
Google
.
Rajeev

co-authored

paper
about
the
project
,
describing
PageRank
and
the
initial
prototype
of
the
Google
search
engine
,
published
in
1998
.
Héctor
García-Molina
and
Jeff

were
also
cited

contributor
to
the
project

by
a

algorithm

,
with
Larry

patent

Eventually
,
they
changed
the

to
signify
that
the

wa
intended
to
provide
large
quantity
of
information
.

Google
's

a
simple

,
which
is
what
allowed
them
to
open
up
their

said
the
company

“

After
Congressional
hearing
in
July
2020
[
321
]
and
a
report
from
the
House
of
Representatives
'
antitrust
subcommittee
released
in
early
October
,
[
322
]
the
United
States
Department
of
Justice
filed
an
antitrust
lawsuit
against
Google
on
October
20
,
2020
,
asserting
that
it
ha
illegally
maintained
it
monopoly
position
in
searching
and
search
advertising
.
[
323
]
[
324
]
The
lawsuit
included
an
accusation
that
Google
engaged
in
anticompetitive
behavior
by
paying
Apple
between
$
8
billion
and
$
12
billion
to
be
the
default
search
engine
on
iPhones
.
[

Ken
Paxton
,
a
Texas
Attorney
General
leading
the
suit
,
stated
that
``
Google
is
a
trillion-dollar
monopoly
brazenly
abusing
it
monopolistic
power
,
going
so
far
a
to
induce
senior
Facebook
executive
to
agree
to
a
contractual
scheme
that
undermines
the
heart
of
[
the
]
competitive
process
.
''
In
part
,
the
suit
challenge
Alphabet
's
capacity
to
fairly
compete
with
the
company
in
online
advertising
.
No
Democratic
politician
joined
Mr.
Paxion
in
the
suit
.
The
majority
of
the
accusation
against
Google
involve
their
ad-tech
software
,
of
which
Google
owns
the
dominant
tool
at
every
link
in
the
chain
connecting
online
publisher
and
advertiser
.
[
326
]
Later
that
month
,
both
Facebook
and
Alphabet
agreed
to
``
cooperate
and
assist
one
another
''
in
the
face
of
investigation
into
their
online
advertising
practice
